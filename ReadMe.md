# Quadratic Equation Solver in Assembly MIPS 
The project contains an assembly MIPS program (.s file) that when executed solves
a quadratic equation. The user types the coefficients a, b, c (integer or floats) and the program uses
them to find the Discriminant (D). Depending the D result (>, =, < 0) the program decides
whether the equation has two, one (double) or no solution. Finally, the program prints
the roots (if there are any).

**Note 1:** The program was developed during my lab examination for an introductory course in the topic of Computer Architecture.

**Note 2:** The program has been tested using [QtSpim simulator](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

**Note 3:** More info on the topic of solving [Quadratic Equation (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation).
